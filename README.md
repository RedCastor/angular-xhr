angular-xhr
==============

Submit XHRs with directives! This means less code for your controllers.

## Installation

You may grab the build, or from bower!

```
bower install angular-srph-xhr
```

## Example

See the docs / live demo [here](https://srph.github.io/angular-xhr)

## Contribution

```
=========      ================
| issue |  ->  | pull-request |
=========      ================
```

For feats, I would suggest to submit an issue first before submitting a pull request. This avoids closed pull-requests.
