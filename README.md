angular-xhr
==============

Submit XHRs with directives.

- Less lines of code for your controllers.
- Explicitly address your XHRs.
- Minus one dependency (```$http```) for your controller.

## Installation

You may grab the build, or from bower!

```bash
bower install angular-srph-xhr
```

While it is also possible to use the one provided by CDNs

```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/srph/angular-xhr/dist/angular-srph-xhr.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/srph/angular-xhr/dist/angular-srph-xhr.min.js"></script>
```

## Docs / Examples

See the docs [here](https://srph.github.io/angular-xhr/reference.html), and the demos [here](https://srph.github.io/angular-xhr/examples).

## Contribution

For features or fixes, I would suggest to submit an issue first before submitting a pull request. This avoids closed pull-requests; useless work.

Don't forget to add tests if necessary.
